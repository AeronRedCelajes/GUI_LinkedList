## Overview

This project is a Java-based Linked List implementation with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It allows users to perform operations like inserting nodes at the beginning or end of the list, deleting nodes, and displaying the current state of the linked list. The project was developed by Celajes, Jimenez and Soriano as part of a final requirement for the **Computer Science** course.

## Features

- **Insert at Beginning**: Adds a new node with user-inputted data at the beginning of the linked list.
- **Insert at End**: Appends a new node with user-inputted data at the end of the linked list.
- **Delete Node**: Removes a node with the specified data from the linked list.
- **Display Linked List**: Displays the current structure of the linked list in the GUI.
